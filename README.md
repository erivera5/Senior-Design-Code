# Senior-Design-Code

In this team project, our sponsor was an aquaculture researcher who needed an updated graphical user interface to accurately and automatically feed his supply of striped bass larvae. Our design improved upon the design of a previous senior design team's user interface by making it easier to control the feeding system without jumping through numerous hoops, such as running the original LiveFeeder through a series of command line prompts in Terminal. Our graphical user interface, created with Python, incorporates graphs and sliders in its design in order to display the information of past feedings, while also enhancing the user-friendliness of the design.

Inputs to the system can be generated and written to three log files using the GUI.py file. The LiveFeeder program is updated to read these three log files and write the requested inputs to variables needed to run the pump-based feeding system, such as data pertaining to concentrations and volumes for each of the five tanks used for feeding fish.

The capability of checking the concentration using an IR detector circuit was descoped from the project due to issues such as time constraints and laboratory access, which were both affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
